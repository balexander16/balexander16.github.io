## My Projects

I am currently working through the Deepdive Java & Android Bootcamp. I'm focusing my personal Android project on building upon Object
Recognition services to implement a real world Roleplaying interactive adventure. My interests I hope to delve into during the course are
how to build interactive software for users beyond normal scopes. Image, audio, and video detection and manipulation are some of the ideas 
I hope to further develop and explore in my time in the bootcamp and beyond.
